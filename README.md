# Amazon-clone
An Amazon webpage clone built using HTML and CSS.
Made use of various HTML tags like header, footer, anchor, unordered lists, div and various meta tags.
Worked on various css properties like font-size, color, background-image, display, justify-content, align-items, border, padding etc. A fun and amazing project to get started with HTML and CSS.
